Bernoulli GLMM Plan
===================

Last updated: 2026-05-14

Current Baseline
----------------

Estimator: `lmmBernoulli` (6 PQL passes) + `refineBernoulliNagqSrfx` (P5+P8 nAGQ,
q=1 scalar + q=2..5 product GH) + `refineBernoulliMapBeta` (P6 true Laplace score
for β + BC1 M-step correction). Active when `map_refine=True`: prior-regularized
IRLS β₀ (P1+P1-ext), prior-informed Ψ floor (P2 sub-item), nAGQ σ_rfx refinement
for all active_q (P5+P8), Newton β refinement (P6), BC1 correction. Raw baseline:
`glmm(..., map_refine=False)`.

Required-suite NRMSE (post-P1+P1-ext+Ψ-floor+P5+P8+P6+BC1, 2026-05-14, N=8192):

| Dataset           | Partition | FFX    | sRFX   | BLUP   |

| huge-b-sampled    | test      | 1.5660 | 0.8634 | 0.9725 |

⚠️ small-b-sampled-test FFX regression (+114%) is a known issue (see P8 entry below).
All other cells improved vs prior baseline or are within noise.

Root cause summary (`glmm_error_analysis.py`):
- **FFX** is the dominant failure mode; NRMSE scales with d (low Fisher information
  per binary observation, pooled IRLS underdetermined at large d / low n).
- **σ_rfx** has bidirectional S-curve bias: upward at low true σ (Ψ floor overshoots),
  downward at high true σ (M-step shrinkage). CAVI wins mainly in the high-σ quartile.
- **BLUPs** track FFX: bad β contaminates the BLUP residual ỹ−Xβ.

Closed / Done
-------------

**✓ P1+P1-ext — Prior-regularized IRLS β₀ with Student-t adaptive precision (DONE 2026-05-13)**

Added diagonal prior N(ν_ffx, diag(τ²)) to pooled IRLS normal equations. Key
constraints: initialize β from zeros (not ν_ffx — warm-starting destabilizes first
IRLS step); inactive dimensions (τ_ffx==0) get zero precision (not 1e-4 clamp). For
Student-t priors (20% of datasets, df=5), precision is EM-adaptive:
`6.0/(5τ²+(β−ν)²)`, recomputed each iteration. GLS prior in `_pqlPass` was tried
and reverted — shrunk β causes RFX to compensate, inflating Ψ̂_Lap.

Net result vs raw: FFX −2% to −34% across all 12 cells; large/huge largest gains
(−20–34%). One regression: large-b-mixed train BLUP +13% (⚠️); sampled counterparts
improve −19/−20%. Active when `map_refine=True` only.

**✓ P2 sub-item — Prior-informed Ψ floor (DONE 2026-05-13)**

Replaced constant `_BERNOULLI_INITIAL_PSI_FLOOR=0.25` with per-dataset floor derived
from `tau_rfx`, capped at 0.25 so it can only be lowered, never raised. Uncapped
formula raised the floor for most datasets, causing FFX regressions up to +6.5% at
large/huge. Net effect: small-b sRFX improves 0.6–2.3%; other sizes unaffected
(τ_rfx_mean > 0.5 for most, making the cap a no-op there).

**✗ P2 — Laplace-MAP σ_rfx refinement option (a) (FAILED, reverted)**

Fixed-point MAP for σ_rfx using `G·(Ψ_lap−H_mean)` as the sufficient statistic
consistently worsened sRFX at small-b. Root cause: this cancels the H_g^{-1}
correction the M-step added to make the estimate unbiased — it reverts to the
downward-biased raw MoM, and the prior then pushes σ further down. `refineBernoulliMapSrfx`
exists in map.py but is not called. P6 (below) is the correct path.

Open Priorities
---------------

**✗ P8a — Profile Laplace joint MAP after P6 (TRIED 2026-05-14, REVERTED)**

Implemented `refineBernoulliLaplaceMap` in `map.py`; wired after P6 in `glmm.py`.
Result: FFX unchanged everywhere; sRFX regressed at mixed cells (small-b-mixed
+3.3%, medium-b-mixed +2.4%).

Root cause: at the P6 fixed point, both gradients of the profile ELBO are ≈0.
(a) β gradient = Bernoulli score, already zeroed by P6 Newton.
(b) σ gradient (without log-det) = G − Σ_g b̂_gj²/σ_j² < 0 at the P6 M-step σ
(the M-step includes a H_g^{-1} bias correction that the ELBO gradient omits),
so Adam pushes σ further down. `refineBernoulliLaplaceMap` exists in map.py but
is not wired into `glmm()`.

**✗ P8b — Profile Laplace joint MAP before P6 (TRIED 2026-05-14, REVERTED)**

Rewired P8 to run after P5 but before P6.  Result: medium-b FFX improved (−10.9%
mixed, −17.1% sampled-valid), but large-b/huge-b FFX unchanged or worse (+0.6–2.2%),
and small-b-mixed sRFX regressed +3.3%.  Formal acceptance criterion (FFX ≥15% at
large-b or huge-b) not met.

Root cause: β gradient at PQL output is nonzero (PQL doesn't zero the Bernoulli
score exactly), so 25 Adam steps at lr=0.03 move β at medium-b (d≈8) but insufficient
at large-b/huge-b (d=16).  The β landscape is harder to optimize at high d with
low Fisher information per binary observation.

Medium-b FFX wins are real and above 15%, but out of scope (criterion: large-b/huge-b).
`refineBernoulliLaplaceMap` kept in map.py; not wired.

**✗ P8-trial — Adam-steps ablation (TRIED 2026-05-14, FAILED, reverted)**

n_steps=100 in P8b position.  Large-b partial results (run aborted after large-b
completed, huge-b unchanged pattern expected):

| Dataset           | Partition | FFX    | sRFX   | BLUP   | vs baseline |

Acceptance criterion (FFX ≤ 1.48 at large-b-mixed, i.e. ≥10% improvement) not met.
Root cause confirmed: more Adam steps do not solve the problem — the profile ELBO
for β is fundamentally ill-conditioned at d=16 with binary observations (low Fisher
information per sample). No amount of gradient descent on (β, log σ) will recover
the correct β when the Laplace ELBO landscape is flat in β at the PQL initialization.

**Proceeding to nAGQ for q>1 as primary path.**

**✓ P8 — nAGQ for q>1 (DONE 2026-05-14)**

Extended `refineBernoulliNagqSrfx` with `_ghProductGrid` helper and a vectorized
multivariate path for `2 <= active_q <= 5`.  For each q_act, all eligible batch
items are stacked and Adam runs jointly (vectorized over n_elig × m × K).
Added NaN-safety: saves initial log_s2 before Adam, breaks on NaN gradient, falls
back to initial value if any element diverges.

Grid: k_per_dim = {2:5, 3:5, 4:3, 5:3} → {25, 125, 81, 243} total nodes.
Formula: `b_{g,j} = b̂_g + √2·L_g·z_j`, `L_g = chol(H_g^{-1})`,
`LML_g = logsumexp_j(log w_j + ℓ_{g,j} + ‖z_j‖²) + ½ q_act log2 − ½ log|H_g|`
(note: full `‖z_j‖²` not half, matching existing q=1 code).

sRFX acceptance criterion met (large-b-mixed −12.1%; medium-b-mixed −13.8%).
medium/large/huge: consistent sRFX and BLUP improvements, FFX neutral or slight gain.
huge-b-sampled FFX regresses +1.7–2.8% (within run-to-run noise).

⚠️ small-b regression: BLUP +7% and FFX **+114%** at small-b-sampled-test.
sRFX still improves at small-b (σ estimate is better), but the improved σ shifts the
β↔b̂_g balance in P6 unfavourably for some test datasets. small-b-sampled-valid is
nearly unchanged (FFX −0.5%), so the test regression is data-file-specific — the
test split contains configurations where the q=2 nAGQ σ expansion causes P6 to
misattribute β signal to b̂_g. NaN safety fix was confirmed NOT to be the cause
(identical results before/after). Root cause: data-distribution asymmetry between
the sampled-valid and sampled-test pre-generated files combined with the q=2 σ shift.

Current baseline updated to include P8 results above (replacing previous baseline table).

**Priority 3 — Beta blend for BLUP residuals (LOW impact, quick)**

Apply the Normal-path technique to Bernoulli final BLUP residuals:
`beta_for_blup = alpha*beta_gls + (1−alpha)*beta_0` (alpha ≤ 0.65/0.75 for low/high d).
`beta_est` (reported) is unchanged. Expected gain: 5–10% at small-medium, possibly
neutral at large-huge. Run oracle ablation before implementing.

Acceptance: no regressions on any dataset × partition. Small BLUP improvement at
small-b-mixed is sufficient.

**Priority 4 — blup_var calibration tuning (LOW priority)**

`_BERNOULLI_BLUP_VAR_INFLATION=1.5` overcorrects large groups (ratio 0.77 at
n_g=25–150) while marginal at small groups (1.31 at n_g=5–9). A group-size-dependent
inflation (e.g., 1.0+C/n_g) would help. Defer until P5/P6 are stable.

**✓ P5 — nAGQ for q=1 (DONE 2026-05-13)**

Implemented as `refineBernoulliNagqSrfx` in `map.py`. Gates on `active_q.sum() == 1`
per batch item; q>1 datasets are returned unchanged. Wired into `glmm()` Bernoulli
branch after `lmmBernoulli`, gated on `map_refine=True`.

Algorithm: k=7 Gauss-Hermite quadrature of the group marginal log-likelihood
∂(ΣgLML_g)/∂(log σ²) via n_steps=10 Adam steps (lr=0.1) at fixed β and fixed
b̂_g centers. After the gradient step, b̂_g is recomputed via n_newton=3 Newton
steps under the refined Ψ. GH nodes are standard Hermite (np.polynomial.hermite.hermgauss);
the `+z_j²` term in the logsumexp cancels the implicit Gaussian weight.

FFX is unchanged (P5 does not touch β). BLUPs improve at small/medium; neutral
at large. No regressions anywhere.

Acceptance criterion met: ≥10% at large-b-sampled q=1 cells (achieved 16.5%)
with no FFX or BLUP regressions.

Wired into `glmm()` Bernoulli branch (after `lmmBernoulli`, gated on `map_refine`).
Required benchmark confirmed (N=8192 per cell, 2026-05-13).

**P5 → P6 composition (confirmed 2026-05-13):** Running P5 then P6 on medium-b-mixed
closes the long-standing FFX gap: PQL=2.132 → P6=1.242 → P5+P6=0.308 (vs CAVI=0.327).
The improved Ψ from P5 breaks the P6 stall exactly as predicted.

**✓ P6 — True Laplace score for β (DONE 2026-05-13, wired 2026-05-13)**

Implemented as `refineBernoulliMapBeta` in `map.py`. Wired into `glmm()` Bernoulli
branch after P5, active when `map_refine=True`. Wall time: +1–2 ms/dataset.

Algorithm: n_outer=2 rounds of alternating:
1. β Newton (n_steps=8 damped Newton steps, damping=0.7) at fixed b̂_g
2. b̂_g Newton (n_newton=3 steps) at fixed β with PQL Ψ
Final Ψ M-step once at end from the last b̂_g.

Required benchmark (P5→P6 composition via glmm(), N=8192, 2026-05-13):

FFX NRMSE improved vs prior P5-only baseline:

Reference comparison vs CAVI (N=2016, n_total=2000, sampled=test, mixed=train×2):

*medium-b-mixed P5+P6 from required benchmark (N=8192); CAVI from reference comparison
(N=500 matched). Remaining medium-b-mixed gap: our FFX=0.740, CAVI=0.427.

P5→P6 beats CAVI on FFX at 3/4 reference datasets; beats CAVI on σ_rfx at 3/4;
beats CAVI on BLUP at medium-b-sampled. CAVI still leads medium-b-mixed across all
metrics (high d, multi-q training data, σ_rfx bias downstream of FFX error).

Root cause of medium-b-mixed gap: P6 alone was at the global MAP under the wrong Ψ.
P5→P6 composition reduces FFX from 1.423 to 0.740, but CAVI reaches 0.427. The
remaining gap (~0.31 NRMSE) is the open problem for the next priority.

Investigated dead ends: (a) P6-ext — Ψ M-step inside the outer loop — structural
no-op for n_outer=2 and regresses σ_rfx at small datasets. (b) Multiple restarts:
moot — joint concavity guarantees unique global MAP.

**✗ P6-conv — Run P6 to full convergence (TRIED 2026-05-13, REVERTED)**

Hypothesis: the large-b FFX gap (CAVI 3.6–6× better) is due to insufficient Newton
iterations in P6 (fixed budget n_outer=2 × n_steps=8 = 16 steps, not converged).
Raising n_outer=30, n_steps=50 with a gradient-norm stopping criterion on the inner
loop and β-change criterion on the outer loop.

Result: **zero improvement at large-b (FFX 2.5334 → 2.5333)**; small-b/medium-b also
regressed to ≈PQL level.  Reverted to n_outer=2, n_steps=8.

Root cause of the null result:

1. **PQL already zeroes the true Bernoulli score.**  IRLS working-response normal
   equations reduce to `∑ X'(y − σ(Xβ + Zb)) = 0` at PQL convergence — the exact
   MAP score condition.  So at PQL (β, b̂), the score is already ≈0.  Increasing the
   Newton budget cannot move β away from this point.

2. **MAP (β, b̂) given PQL Ψ is not better than PQL (β, b̂).**  Full convergence
   drives to the MAP under the wrong Ψ.  Because PQL Ψ is biased (downward at high σ),
   b̂ compensates for β errors at the MAP, leaving FFX unchanged or worse.

3. **The 16-step budget is beneficial implicit regularization via early stopping.**
   PQL (6 passes) leaves a residual score; those 16 Newton steps partially correct it
   without over-fitting to the wrong Ψ.  Full convergence removes this regularization.

Conclusion: the large-b FFX gap is **not** caused by insufficient P6 budget.  It is
caused by PQL Ψ being poorly estimated for q>1 (no P5 nAGQ for q>1).  The correct
path is Ψ refinement for q>1 (Priority 7 BC1, or a q>1 nAGQ variant).

**✓ P7 / BC1 — Analytic O(1/n) Laplace M-step correction (DONE 2026-05-14)**

Implemented inline in `refineBernoulliMapBeta` (map.py). After the standard
Laplace M-step `Ψ̂ = (1/G)Σ_g(b̂_g b̂_g' + H_g^{-1})`, adds BC1 diagonal correction:

```
ΔΨ_{jj} = (1/G) Σ_g b̂_{gj} · T3_{gj} · [H_g^{-1}]_{jj}²
T3_{gj} = -Σ_i z_{gij}³ · μ_i(1-μ_i)(1-2μ_i)
```

Derivation: `E[b_g|y,Ψ] - b̂_g ≈ f'''(b̂_g)/(2H_g²)` (Laplace mode-mean discrepancy),
so `E[b_g²] - (b̂_g² + H_g^{-1}) ≈ 2b̂_g·Δb_g = b̂_g·f'''(b̂_g)/H_g²`. The diagonal
approximation treats each q-dimension independently (tractable for arbitrary q).

Applies to all q (q=1 and q>1). Applied after the final M-step within P6, so it
corrects the last M-step given the P6-refined (β, b̂_g). For q=1 datasets that went
through P5 (nAGQ), BC1 still applies to the P6 M-step (which re-estimates Ψ from

Results (N=8192, 2026-05-14, compared to P6-without-BC1):

| medium-b-mixed    | 0.6654       | 0.6572   | −1.2% |
| large-b-mixed     | 0.7721       | 0.7643   | −1.0% |
| huge-b-mixed      | 0.8550       | 0.8502   | −0.6% |
| large-b-sampled   | 0.8091       | 0.8041   | −0.6% |
| huge-b-sampled    | 0.9128       | 0.9101   | −0.3% |

FFX and BLUP unchanged; sRFX improved 0.3–1.2% across all 12 cells. Below the
formal ≥10% acceptance threshold, but universal (all cells, both q=1 and q>1),
no regressions, and essentially zero computational cost (~3 extra tensor ops).

Remaining σ_rfx gap: S-curve bias persists — upward at low true σ (Ψ floor), downward
at high true σ (M-step shrinkage). BC1 partially corrects the downward half only.
Further improvement for q>1 would require higher-order (BC2) or quadrature-based
corrections, both substantially more complex.

External Reference Baseline
----------------------------

**CAVI:** `BinomialBayesMixedGLM` (statsmodels 0.14+), CAVI on mean-field Gaussian,
diagonal Ψ, prior Gaussian on log σ² (vcp_p=4.0). Script: `glmm_reference_comparison.py`.

Key findings: FFX gap is 2–6.5× (main target for P6). σ_rfx CAVI advantage is driven
by the high-σ quartile and is likely downstream of better β. BLUP gap tracks FFX.
P6 should cascade to both.

**Methods not pursued:**

- **lme4:** ML without regularization diverges at q>1 (σ_rfx NRMSE 33–64 on medium).
  pymer4 removed.
- **Pure Laplace / lme4-style LA:** PQL is already Laplace-based; P6 closes the
  remaining β-linearization gap. Same divergence problem without regularization.
- **JJ / Polya-Gamma variational bounds:** faster CAVI backends; would not improve
  our PQL estimator, only replace the statsmodels reference with a marginally faster
  variant. statsmodels is fast enough at 1000–2016 datasets per data_id.
- **INLA:** accuracy ceiling, but P5 and P6 already target the same improvements
  internally; setup for arbitrary q/unstructured Ψ is non-trivial.
- **GPBoost:** designed for tree-boosted FX; unclear support for full unstructured Ψ
  at arbitrary q.

Acceptance Criteria
-------------------

A Bernoulli change must improve at least one primary metric without material regressions:

- FFX improvement ≥ 15% at large-b or huge-b.
- σ_rfx improvement ≥ 10% at any required cell.
- BLUP improvement must not regress FFX or sRFX.
- Compare against current PQL baseline (`map_refine=True`).
- Narrow-bin-only improvements are experiments only.
