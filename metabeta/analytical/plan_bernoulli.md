Bernoulli GLMM Plan
===================

Last updated: 2026-05-13

Current Baseline
----------------

Estimator: `lmmBernoulli` (6 PQL passes). Active when `map_refine=True`: prior-
regularized IRLS β₀ (P1+P1-ext) and prior-informed Ψ floor (P2 sub-item). Raw
baseline: `glmm(..., map_refine=False)`.

Required-suite NRMSE (post-P1+P1-ext+Ψ-floor, 2026-05-13):

Root cause summary (`glmm_error_analysis.py`):
- **FFX** is the dominant failure mode; NRMSE scales with d (low Fisher information
  per binary observation, pooled IRLS underdetermined at large d / low n).
- **σ_rfx** has bidirectional S-curve bias: upward at low true σ (Ψ floor overshoots),
  downward at high true σ (M-step shrinkage). CAVI wins mainly in the high-σ quartile.
- **BLUPs** track FFX: bad β contaminates the BLUP residual ỹ−Xβ.

Closed / Done
-------------

**✓ P1+P1-ext — Prior-regularized IRLS β₀ with Student-t adaptive precision (DONE 2026-05-13)**

Added diagonal prior N(ν_ffx, diag(τ²)) to pooled IRLS normal equations. Key
constraints: initialize β from zeros (not ν_ffx — warm-starting destabilizes first
IRLS step); inactive dimensions (τ_ffx==0) get zero precision (not 1e-4 clamp). For
Student-t priors (20% of datasets, df=5), precision is EM-adaptive:
`6.0/(5τ²+(β−ν)²)`, recomputed each iteration. GLS prior in `_pqlPass` was tried
and reverted — shrunk β causes RFX to compensate, inflating Ψ̂_Lap.

Net result vs raw: FFX −2% to −34% across all 12 cells; large/huge largest gains
(−20–34%). One regression: large-b-mixed train BLUP +13% (⚠️); sampled counterparts
improve −19/−20%. Active when `map_refine=True` only.

**✓ P2 sub-item — Prior-informed Ψ floor (DONE 2026-05-13)**

Replaced constant `_BERNOULLI_INITIAL_PSI_FLOOR=0.25` with per-dataset floor derived
from `tau_rfx`, capped at 0.25 so it can only be lowered, never raised. Uncapped
formula raised the floor for most datasets, causing FFX regressions up to +6.5% at
large/huge. Net effect: small-b sRFX improves 0.6–2.3%; other sizes unaffected
(τ_rfx_mean > 0.5 for most, making the cap a no-op there).

**✗ P2 — Laplace-MAP σ_rfx refinement option (a) (FAILED, reverted)**

Fixed-point MAP for σ_rfx using `G·(Ψ_lap−H_mean)` as the sufficient statistic
consistently worsened sRFX at small-b. Root cause: this cancels the H_g^{-1}
correction the M-step added to make the estimate unbiased — it reverts to the
downward-biased raw MoM, and the prior then pushes σ further down. `refineBernoulliMapSrfx`
exists in map.py but is not called. P6 (below) is the correct path.

Open Priorities
---------------

**Priority 3 — Beta blend for BLUP residuals (LOW impact, quick)**

Apply the Normal-path technique to Bernoulli final BLUP residuals:
`beta_for_blup = alpha*beta_gls + (1−alpha)*beta_0` (alpha ≤ 0.65/0.75 for low/high d).
`beta_est` (reported) is unchanged. Expected gain: 5–10% at small-medium, possibly
neutral at large-huge. Run oracle ablation before implementing.

Acceptance: no regressions on any dataset × partition. Small BLUP improvement at
small-b-mixed is sufficient.

**Priority 4 — blup_var calibration tuning (LOW priority)**

`_BERNOULLI_BLUP_VAR_INFLATION=1.5` overcorrects large groups (ratio 0.77 at
n_g=25–150) while marginal at small groups (1.31 at n_g=5–9). A group-size-dependent
inflation (e.g., 1.0+C/n_g) would help. Defer until P5/P6 are stable.

**Priority 5 — nAGQ for q=1 (OPEN, next natural step)**

For datasets with a scalar random effect (q=1), replace single-Laplace marginal
with k=7 adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature to remove the Breslow-Lin downward
bias in Ψ̂. Gates on `active_q.sum() == 1`; not tractable for q>1 (k^q nodes).
This is also the targeted fix for the medium-b-mixed P6 FFX gap: the gap is
caused by biased PQL Ψ (confirmed 2026-05-13); a better Ψ from nAGQ should
cascade to β and BLUPs via P6's joint MAP.

After the final PQL Newton loop has found b̂_g and H_g = ZWZ_g + Ψ^{-1}:

    z_j, w_j   : standard GH nodes/weights (k=7, pre-computed once per call)
    σ_g        : H_g^{-0.5}  (scalar curvature scale)
    b_{g,j}    : b̂_g + √2 · σ_g · z_j
    ℓ_{g,j}   : log p(y_g | β, b_{g,j}) + log p(b_{g,j} | Ψ)
    LML_g      : logsumexp_j(w_j + ℓ_{g,j} + z_j²) + log(√2 · σ_g)

Use ∂(ΣgLML_g)/∂(log σ²) for a single gradient step on σ_rfx after the PQL outer
loop, then one final `_pqlPass` with the nAGQ-refined Ψ to recompute BLUPs.
The `+z_j²` term cancels the implicit Gaussian weight in standard GH.

Acceptance: ≥10% σ_rfx NRMSE reduction at large-b-sampled (current ≈0.85) with
no FFX or BLUP regressions, restricted to q=1 cells only.

**✓ P6 — True Laplace score for β (DONE 2026-05-13)**

Implemented as `refineBernoulliMapBeta` in `map.py`. Called explicitly after
`lmmBernoulli` in the reference comparison; not yet wired into `glmm()`.

Algorithm: n_outer=2 rounds of alternating:
1. β Newton (n_steps=8 damped Newton steps, damping=0.7) at fixed b̂_g
2. b̂_g Newton (n_newton=3 steps) at fixed β with PQL Ψ
Final Ψ M-step once at end from the last b̂_g.  Wall time: +1–2 ms/dataset.

Results (sampled=test / mixed=train×2, n_total=2000, 2026-05-13, N=2016):

P6 beats CAVI on FFX for 3/4 datasets (2–4.5× improvement over PQL).
medium-b-mixed FFX gap persists (1.24 vs 0.327).

σ_rfx: P6 beats PQL uniformly (all quartiles, 2–6% RMSE reduction).
P6 beats CAVI on small-b-mixed; CAVI still leads at medium where σ_rfx is
downstream of the FFX gap.  BLUP: marginal improvement over PQL (<1%).

Root cause of medium-b-mixed gap (2026-05-13): The Bernoulli joint log-posterior
in (β, b̂_g) is globally concave for fixed Ψ, so P6 is already at the global MAP —
not a local optimum. The gap is entirely a Ψ estimation problem: the PQL Ψ is
biased by the wrong initial β, and the globally optimal β under the wrong Ψ is
still wrong. Investigated: (a) P6-ext — Ψ M-step inside the outer loop — found
to be a structural no-op for n_outer=2 (the Ψ update doesn't propagate to β
within that turn) and also reverted because it regresses σ_rfx at small datasets.
(b) Multiple restarts: ruled out — joint concavity guarantees all initializations
converge to the same global MAP for fixed Ψ. Correct fix: better Ψ estimator,
i.e., P5 (nAGQ), which directly addresses the Laplace bias in Ψ̂.

**Priority 7 — BC1 σ_rfx correction for q>1 (contingent on P6, OPEN)**

Hold until P6 is complete. If σ_rfx gap persists in q>1 datasets after P6, the
Breslow-Lin (1995) BC1 adds an analytic O(1/n) correction to the M-step that
reduces downward bias in the high-σ_rfx quartile. Unlike P5 nAGQ, tractable for
arbitrary q; weaker (first-order only). Do not pursue before P6 — the σ_rfx gap
is largely downstream of FFX error and should cascade when β improves.

σ_rfx bias direction: S-curve — upward bias at low true σ (Ψ floor overshoots),
downward at high true σ (M-step shrinkage). BC1 addresses only the downward half.

External Reference Baseline
----------------------------

**CAVI:** `BinomialBayesMixedGLM` (statsmodels 0.14+), CAVI on mean-field Gaussian,
diagonal Ψ, prior Gaussian on log σ² (vcp_p=4.0). Script: `glmm_reference_comparison.py`.

| Med-high (0.46–0.91) | −0.10–0.17 | 0.22–0.31 | +0.06–0.11 | 0.23–0.28 | ~tie |
| High (≥0.91)      | −0.43–0.62 | 0.64–0.83 | −0.25–0.39 | 0.46–0.58 | **CAVI** |

Key findings: FFX gap is 2–6.5× (main target for P6). σ_rfx CAVI advantage is driven
by the high-σ quartile and is likely downstream of better β. BLUP gap tracks FFX.
P6 should cascade to both.

**Methods not pursued:**

- **lme4:** ML without regularization diverges at q>1 (σ_rfx NRMSE 33–64 on medium).
  pymer4 removed.
- **Pure Laplace / lme4-style LA:** PQL is already Laplace-based; P6 closes the
  remaining β-linearization gap. Same divergence problem without regularization.
- **JJ / Polya-Gamma variational bounds:** faster CAVI backends; would not improve
  our PQL estimator, only replace the statsmodels reference with a marginally faster
  variant. statsmodels is fast enough at 1000–2016 datasets per data_id.
- **INLA:** accuracy ceiling, but P5 and P6 already target the same improvements
  internally; setup for arbitrary q/unstructured Ψ is non-trivial.
- **GPBoost:** designed for tree-boosted FX; unclear support for full unstructured Ψ
  at arbitrary q.

Acceptance Criteria
-------------------

A Bernoulli change must improve at least one primary metric without material regressions:

- FFX improvement ≥ 15% at large-b or huge-b.
- σ_rfx improvement ≥ 10% at any required cell.
- BLUP improvement must not regress FFX or sRFX.
- Compare against current PQL baseline (`map_refine=True`).
- Narrow-bin-only improvements are experiments only.
